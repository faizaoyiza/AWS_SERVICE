# üì¶ AWS S3 Bucket Project Guide ‚Äì Instructor-Compliant Submission

## ‚úÖ Objective

This guide demonstrates how to:
- Create an Amazon S3 bucket
- Upload a text file to the bucket
- Enable versioning with verification
- Configure bucket policy to allow public access to the object
- Implement a lifecycle rule to transition objects to a lower-cost storage class

All steps include clear instructions, screenshots (where applicable), and align with the specific tasks required by the instructor.
