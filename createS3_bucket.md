# 📦 How to Create an S3 Bucket on AWS

This guide explains how to create an Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS Management Console. S3 buckets are used to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- An active [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- IAM user with permissions to create S3 buckets (e.g., `AmazonS3FullAccess` or custom policy)

---

## 📌 Steps to Create an S3 Bucket

### 1. Log into AWS Console

- Go to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
- Search for **S3** in the search bar and select it

---

### 2. Create a New Bucket

- Click **Create bucket**

---

### 3. Configure Bucket Settings

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Bucket name** | Must be globally unique (e.g., `gatogrowfast-assets`) |
| **Region** | Choose the AWS Region close to your users |
| **Object Ownership** | Keep as default (`ACLs disabled`) unless you need custom access control |
| **Block Public Access** | Leave all options **checked** to keep data private |

## 🧪 Testing Your Bucket

### Upload a File
1. Click on your newly created bucket
2. Click **Upload**
3. Add files and click **Upload**

### Make an Object Public (Optional)
> Only do this if you intend to publicly serve the file (e.g., images or static websites)

1. Select the file
2. Click **Actions > Make public**
3. Confirm and copy the URL

---

## 🔐 Secure Your Bucket

- Avoid making your bucket public unless absolutely necessary
- Use IAM policies and bucket policies to control access
- Enable MFA delete if needed for extra protection

---

## 🧼 Clean Up (To Avoid Charges)

If you no longer need the bucket:
1. Delete all objects inside the bucket
2. Go back to the bucket list and click **Delete**
3. Confirm the bucket name and delete it
